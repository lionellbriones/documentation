# Scalability/Layer2 Solutions

DirectAuth is integrable with most \(if not all\) scalability solutions, no matter the flavour. This includes, but is not limited to: Matic or other plasma implementations, SKALE, Optimistic roll ups \(be it Arbitrium, Optimism or even other chains\), state channels like Connext or even PoA networks.

EthHub has a great [write up ](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/state-channels/)of the different flavours/options out there, and whilst its specific to Ethereum many of the other techncial techniques are implemented on other chains.
